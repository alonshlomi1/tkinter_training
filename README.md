Snake Game and Minesweeper Game in Python using Tkinter

Description
This project contains two classic games, Snake and Minesweeper, implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

The Snake game is a simple game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen and eats food to grow longer.
The player loses if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.

The Minesweeper game is a classic game of strategy where the player has to clear a board of hidden mines without detonating them.
The player can reveal squares and use logic to determine where the mines are located.
